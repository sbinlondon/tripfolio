        <p>
          Tripfolio aims to take the difficulty out of travel planning, whether it's a solo trip, you and 
          your partner having a weekend getaway, or 25 friends going on a ski trip together.
          <br>
          <br>
          For avid travellers, there are so many apps available to cover parts of trip planning. But where is 
          the app that centralises everything in one place, making trip planning an easy, fun, collaborative 
          experience? Tripfolio wants to be that app: storing your travel info, helping you find the best places 
          to visit wherever you're going, making splitting travel costs easy, and much more.

          <p>Kate and Joe met at Founders & Coders, the UK’s leading coding course.</p>
          <p>Having gained a lot of experience across business development, marketing and ops, they both now are getting the
            vital programming skills that enable them to bring their ideas to life. Currently, both Kate and Joe are becoming 
            proficient in everything involved in full stack development.</p>
          <p>As with any good idea, Tripfolio comes out of a need to solve a problem both cofounders have faced and bonded over.
            Both are avid travellers, with Joe having spent the past year travelling the world (a large chunk of which
            involved living in a van with his dog!) and Kate having lived in the US, Munich, and London. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Kate" class="tabcontent">
          <p>
            Kate has a varied background, having built a career as a freelance writer and photographer before deciding to 
            join the fast-paced startup world at companies like tails.com and Monzo as an office manager. However, her 
            need to create and innovate kept calling. This led her to leave her last job and take a chance on learning to code 
            so she could channel her creativity into solving problems and building solutions through programming.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Joe" class="tabcontent">
          <p>
            Joe's career has been spent bringing ideas to life. Having spent 5 years building Fun Kids into a national 
            award-winning brand, he went on to run an influencer marketing company called Social Circle, innovating and overseeing
            the development of a specialist influencer tech platform. After setting up a new influencer agency for Good Relations, 
            he quit his job to spend the year travelling while learning to code, experiencing first-hand the issues that we are now
            looking to solve at Tripfolio.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>Aside from travelling, Joe enjoys nothing more than bringing ideas to life.</p>
          <p>Having started in a team of five at children’s radio station, Fun Kids, over 5 years he helped grow it into a national
            award-winning brand with over 300,000 listeners every week and year-on-year growth in profits. During that time,
            he ran day-to-day operations, business development and marketing, with one of his strategic partnerships leading
            to the brand’s highest ever audience and winning Innovation of the Year at the UK’s leading radio awards.
          </p>
          <p>Following his time there, he then ran an influencer marketing company called Social Circle, providing a managed
            service for brands looking to work with social stars online. During this time, he innovated and oversaw the development
            of a specialist influencer tech platform with a proprietary algorithm to properly identify and evaluate influencers.
            This work led to him being approached by Good Relations, to create and build a new influencer division for them,
            which quickly gained a range of global clients including Canon, Subway, and B&Q.
