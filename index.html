          <p>Kate and Joe met at Founders & Coders, the UK’s leading coding bootcamp.</p>
          <p>Having gained a lot of experience across business development, marketing and ops, they both now are getting the
            vital developer skills that enable them to bring their ideas to life. Currently both Kate and Joe are becoming
            proficient in Javascript, Node and SQL, and everything involved in full stack development.</p>
          <p>As with any good idea, Mapping comes out of selfish need to solve a problem both of us have faced and bonded over.
            Both of us are avid travellers, with Joe having spent the past year travelling the world (a large chunk of which
            involved living in a van with his dog!) and Kate having already lived in the States, to Munich, to London. </p>

          <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

          <p>Aside from travelling, Joe enjoys nothing more than bringing ideas to life.</p>
          <p>Having started in a team of five at children’s radio station, Fun Kids, over 5 years he helped grow it into a national
            award-winning brand with over 300,000 listeners every week and year-on-year growth in profits. During that time
            he ran day-to-day operations, business development and marketing, with one of his strategic partnerships leading
            to the brand’s highest ever audience and winning Innovation of the Year at the UK’s leading radio awards.</p>
          <p>Following his time there, he then ran an influencer marketing company called Social Circle, providing a managed
            service for brands looking to work with social stars online. During this time he innovated and oversaw the development
            of a specialist influencer tech platform with a proprietary algorithm to properly identify and evaluate influencers.
            This work led to him being approached by Good Relations, to create and build a new influencer division for them,
            which quickly gained a range of global clients including Canon, Subway and B&Q.</p>
